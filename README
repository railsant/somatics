== Welcome to Somatics

Somatics is a default Ruby on Rails project that kick-starts your next Rails project.

Read the next paragraph for a quickstart.

== Getting Started

These 6 simple steps are the essentials to get you smoothly up and running…

   1. Create your own config/database.yml (you can copy one of the sample files in there and edit it)
   2. Open a shell and run rake db:create db:migrate to create your database and setup the prepared defaults.
   4. Start your server with ./script/server
   5. Open up http://localhost:3000 and login with username ‘admin’ and password ‘password’.
