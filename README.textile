h1. Getting Started

These 4 simple steps are the essentials to get you smoothly up and running…

# Create your own config/database.yml (you can copy one of the sample files in there and edit it)
# Open a shell and run rake db:create db:migrate to create your database and setup the prepared defaults.
# Start your server with ./script/server
# Open up http://localhost:3000 and login with username ‘admin’ and password ‘password’.
